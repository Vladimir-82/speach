Hello!
I used TTS coqui Text-to-Speech.
I imported ModelManager and Synthesizer.
I used IPython to create the audio object.
And than I Saved an audio file from an object.
Listening to the file through vlc player.

This is the beginning of the service and I can improve the code and
add more control buttons.
