Now I will tell you about task number 5.
To do this, I used coqui. I Installed the TTS library.
Defititly it was difficalteis.I had never done such work before.
But I completed the project.

I used random model.
Also I imported ModelManager and Synthesizer.
I used IPython to create the audio object.
And than I Saved an audio file from an object.

I created the path.
Listening to the file through vlc player.

Now I will run the aplication.

I used interface from previous project.

For the application to work, I will use the text from Lorem Ipsum.


This is the beginning of the service and I can improve the code and
add more control buttons.
